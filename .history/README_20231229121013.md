# 新型學習演算法
新型學習演算法(2021)：蔡瑞煌教授於政大資管系所開授的課程

## Introduction
The learning algorithm is revised learning mechanism based on two layer net with dynamic adjusting learning rate and three stopping criteria, which is epochs, small residual, and small learning rate, mentioned in cs231n. To overcome the overfitting and learning dilemma issues, two module, reorganizing module and cramming, are proposed to cope with each issues respectively.

## Goals
Predicting copper price.

## Data
With 

## Mechanism
### LTS

### Weight Tuning Module
- Based module
- If acceptable: go to Reorganise module
- If not acceptable: go to Cramming

### Reorganising Module
- Coping with Overfitting
    - Weight tuning module
    - Regularising module

### Cramming Module
- Ruled based adding nodes
- For each case that did not fit well to the model, assign three nodes for the case in the model, where the weights for each nodes is predefined

### Full Module
1. Start and INitilasie with hidden node size 1
2. Let n = obtaining_LTS, n += 1 # n: picked data to train in traing data
    - The obtaining_LTS
    - if n > N break # N: all training data
3. Selecting _LTS(n). I(n) = the picked data indexes
4. If the learning goal for picked train data satisfied (max(eps) <= learning goal), Go step 7; Otherwise, there is oen and onlly one k in n that cause contradicton and k = [n]    
5. Save weight
6. Weight tune the current SLFN
    - IF acceptable: go step 7
    - Otherwise, restore weight cram to get acceptable SLFN
7. Reorganise SLFN
8. GO to step 2


## Result
Final model for each module store in acceptable/~
