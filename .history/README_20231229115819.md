# 新型學習演算法

## Introduction
The learning algorithm is revised learning mechanism based on two layer net with dynamic adjusting learning rate and three stopping criteria, which is epochs, small residual, and small learning rate, mentioned in cs231n. To overcome the overfitting and learning dilemma issues, two module, reorganizing module and cramming, are proposed to cope with each issues respectively.

## Goals
Predicting ETH price.

## Data
From Kaggle, ETH data per 30 minutes.
Columns: Open Time, ...

## Mechanism
### LTS

### Weight Tuning Module
- Based module
- If acceptable: go to Reorganise module
- If not acceptable: go to Cramming

### Reorganising Module
- Coping with Overfitting
    - Weight tuning module
    - Regularising module

### Cramming Module
- Ruled based adding nodes
- For each case that did not fit well to the model, assign three nodes for the case in the model, where the weights for each nodes is predefined

### Full Module
- Start with hidden node size 1
- Let n = obtaining_LTS, n += 1 n: 
    - The obtaining_LTS
    - if n > N break # 
- Weight Tunig Module
- Cramming Module (Option)
- Reorganise Module


## Result
Final model for each module store in acceptable/~
